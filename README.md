# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

## Andy Tran

This is my implementation of the take-home project from the Cloudflare 2020 Summer Internship. Here's a list of working features:

- Requests variant URLS from API.
- Distributes visitors roughly 50/50 on both variants.
- Changes content from the variant to display to user (page title, h1, body, link).
- Cookies to keep same user on the same variant for 24 hours (or until cookie cleared).

The Web page can be accessed here through Cloudflare Workers:
